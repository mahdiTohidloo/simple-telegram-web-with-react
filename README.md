## Simple Telegram Web App With React.js

In this project, I've implemented a minimal Telegram Web Application with React.
This project is powered by `create-react-app`. 
I've used `React Hooks` and `Context API` to implement the project

 
All you need to run this project is: 

- Download the project
- run ` npm install`
- run `npm start`

And you can see it on `localhost:3000`. Hope to enjoy it. 
Feel free to contribute :)
